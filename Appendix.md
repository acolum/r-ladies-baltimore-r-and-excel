# Appendix

## Packages Used (Alphabetical Order)

-   [DataEditR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataEditR/index.html)

-   [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html)

-   [openxlsx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/index.html)

    -   Utilizes the [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package and no Java dependencies.

-   [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html)

    -   Zero dependencies.

-   [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)

-   [writexl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/writexl/index.html)

    -   Zero dependencies.

-   [XLConnect](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XLConnect/index.html)

    -   Java dependencies.

-   [xlsx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsx/index.html)

    -   Java dependencies.

## 01_read.R

-   This script (and consequently all five scripts in the workflow) assumes that the data being imported is in a tabular format. If the data in Excel is not in a tabular format, it can still be imported into R with the [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/) package.

-   If you want to read in password-protected Excel files or sheets, the openxlsx, XLConnect, and xlsx packages can all do this. However, if you would like to write password-protected Excel files or sheets, only the openxlsx package can do this.

-   Please note that you can't use both of the XLConnect and xlsx packages in the same R session. This is because they have conflicting Java dependencies (i.e., [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/)).

-   The readxl package generally performs better than openxlsx in reading data into R from Excel files. According to [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44538199/fast-way-to-read-xlsx-files-into-r), readxl is, on average, about twice as fast as openxlsx.

    -   If you only need to read data into Excel, I recommend using this package.

-   readxl has zero dependencies, so it's simple to load and reliable to use across operating systems and platforms.

## 04_visualize.R

-   In this script, I show how to embed R charts as images in Excel workbooks, but it doesn't seem like there's an R package yet for making Excel-native or -editable charts in R.

    -   The only ways I can think of to do this are (1) to write VBA code to make the chart and run this code from R, or (2) to use the [XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) Python package with the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package to produce the chart.

    -   If you want to make MS Word or PowerPoint-native charts, you can use the [mschart](https://ardata-fr.github.io/mschart/) package.

    -   If you'd like to make your ggplot2 chart look like an Excel chart, you can use ggplot2 themes to make your chart look like it was generated by older versions of Excel ([`theme_excel`](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/theme_excel.html)) or current versions of Excel ([`theme_excel_new`](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/theme_excel_new.html)).

## 05_share.R

-   The writexl package generally has better performance than openxlsx in writing data to Excel files. According to [this post by rOpenSci](https://docs.ropensci.org/writexl/), writexl is, on average, about two times faster than openxlsx. Also, the Excel files written by writexl are smaller than those generated by openxlsx.

    -   If you only need to write data to Excel, I recommend using this package.

-   Like readxl, writexl has zero dependencies, so it's easy and reliable to use across operating systems and platforms.
